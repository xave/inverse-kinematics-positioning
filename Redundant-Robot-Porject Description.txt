My project is calculating the inverse kinamatics of a slightly redundant robot in order to manipulate its position (but not orientation) is 3D space.  

The function should be called with three input variables (xd, yd, zd), where xd, yd, and zd are the desired positions in the x-, y-, and z-directions, respectively.
